Our platform welcomes all fitness levels, providing structured workout routines from basic to advanced, ensuring progression for everyone. Our distinctive feature is the customized fitness plans, designed to meet each user's unique preferences.

We address common issues like beginners' confusion over exercises and the lack of tailored fitness guidance. Our health website is built on the robust MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), with a front-end primarily using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enhanced by Bootstrap for a visually appealing interface. The back-end, powered by Express, Node.js, and Mongoose, ensures scalability and a seamless user experience. Step up your fitness game with us and experience a journey uniquely yours.

next, this is our home page this is designed for people who know somewhat about working out and who mainly want to create their own workout schedule. they can click on any body parts they want to train and it will give them the option to add that body part to the calendar this is how they can create their own workout schedule

next, after we did our survey we found that a lot of people were having a hard time figuring out what would be a good starting point for them so this is why we created this starter page where users can select between any body parts they want to train and it will give them stages to do. It will start from the lowest and safest state and it will work its way up.

next for people who lack personalized fitness guidance and who has hard time tracking and creating their schedule we have created this planner pager for them. Here they can choose between a few plan and it will give them the workout and meal plan schedule for those weeks. if the user has a hard time selecting which plan is good for them they can use our fitness helper where they just have to answer a few questions and it will give them the recommended plan.

for example, if the user selects the 2-week plan it will give them the workout and meal plan for the next 2 weeks. our meal plan also includes macros related to each meal and if the user does not know how many calories they should consume we have a salary calculator for them as well.

in the future, we are planning to add more features based on user needs and that is why we have kept our survey open and we are getting valuable information regarding what the user wants.
